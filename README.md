# PowerBI-Sales-Analytics-Expansion-Dashboard
This Power BI project presents an end-to-end Sales Analysis and Expansion Report for BuyNex, providing actionable insights into company performance, regional trends, and customer behavior.

The Sales Analysis Report highlights key KPIs such as Gross Revenue ($1.48M), Gross Profit ($1.19M), and Order Count (9,356). It compares male vs. female customer revenue, tracks quarterly performance, and analyzes profit share by regions and payment preferences.

The Sales Expansion Plan focuses on growth opportunities, showing top profit-generating states, sales YoY growth by region, and order trends before and after COVID-19. It also maps sales growth vs. potential, helping in strategic decision-making.

The data model integrates multiple dimension tables (Region, State, Dates, Order Type, Payment Type, etc.) connected to a central Order Table, enabling efficient relational analysis and flexible KPI computation.

This project demonstrates data modeling, visualization design, and business intelligence storytelling using Power BI to deliver clear insights for both performance review and expansion strategy.
